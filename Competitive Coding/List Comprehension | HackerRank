Question : Let's learn about list comprehensions! You are given three integers and representing the dimensions of a cuboid along with an integer . 
Print a list of all possible coordinates given by on a 3D grid where the sum of is not equal to . Here, .
Please use list comprehensions rather than multiple loops, as a learning exercise. (View Full From ðŸ”— URL )
